<h2> About QuestDB</h2>

We are building an open source time-series database focused on performance and
simplicity.

QuestDB is used to store, process and analyze time-series data in real-time
across a wide range of industries, such as Financial Services, Energy,
Manufacturing, Web3 and Space Exploration. Fortune 500 companies such as Airbus
and Yahoo deploy QuestDB for large-scale, data-intensive production systems,
some of which serve close to a billion users.

Our open source repository has gathered 11k+ stars in three years, and 
is the fastest-growing in our category. We are a product-first company with 
a large community of developers. We are a globally distributed remote-first 
team backed by leading venture capital firms and Y Combinator.
